# trailmark

**Source code graph analysis for security auditing.** Parses code into queryable graphs of functions, classes, and calls, then uses that structure for diagram generation, mutation testing triage, protocol verification, and differential review.

## Prerequisites

[Trailmark](https://pypi.org/project/trailmark/) ([source](https://github.com/trailofbits/trailmark)) must be installed:

```bash
uv pip install trailmark
```

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `trailmark` | Build and query multi-language code graphs with pre-analysis passes (blast radius, taint, privilege boundaries, entrypoints) |
| `diagramming-code` | Generate Mermaid diagrams from code graphs (call graphs, class hierarchies, complexity heatmaps, data flow) |
| `crypto-protocol-diagram` | Extract protocol message flow from source code or specs (RFC, ProVerif, Tamarin) into sequence diagrams |
| `genotoxic` | Triage mutation testing results using graph analysis — classify survived mutants as false positives, missing tests, or fuzzing targets |
| `vector-forge` | Mutation-driven test vector generation — find coverage gaps via mutation testing, then generate Wycheproof-style vectors that close them |
| `graph-evolution` | Compare code graphs at two snapshots to surface security-relevant structural changes text diffs miss |
| `mermaid-to-proverif` | Convert Mermaid sequence diagrams into ProVerif formal verification models |
| `audit-augmentation` | Project SARIF and weAudit findings onto code graphs as annotations and subgraphs |
