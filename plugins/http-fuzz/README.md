# http-fuzz

Smart HTTP request fuzzing with agent-driven semantic input generation and anomaly detection.

## What it does

`http-fuzz` accepts an HTTP request in any common format — raw HTTP text, a `curl` command, or a
HAR file — extracts every fuzz target (query parameters, body fields, headers, path segments),
and uses the LLM to generate contextually meaningful fuzz inputs for each one. A corpus of
values is saved to disk for reuse, then a threaded Python executor runs the campaign and streams
results back for semantic anomaly detection.

Key differentiator: inputs are generated by reasoning about what a parameter *means*, not by blind
mutation. An `email` field gets email-specific edge cases; a `role` field gets privilege-escalation
probes; a `filename` field gets path traversal sequences. The result is a focused, high-signal
fuzz run rather than a high-noise shotgun blast.

## Usage

Provide an HTTP request in one of three formats:

**Raw HTTP:**
```
POST /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer abc123

{"email": "user@example.com", "role": "member"}
```

**curl command:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://example.com/api/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "role": "member"}'
```

**HAR file:** Export from Chrome DevTools → Network tab → right-click → Copy all as HAR.

Then invoke the skill and follow the guided workflow.

## Output

- `./corpus/<param-name>.txt` — reusable corpus files (one fuzz value per line)
- `./http-fuzz-report.md` — markdown report with anomaly table and per-finding explanations

## Authorization

Only use this skill against systems you are explicitly authorized to test. Unauthorized testing is
illegal in most jurisdictions.

## Requirements

- `uv` (for running Python scripts): https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
- Network access to the target
