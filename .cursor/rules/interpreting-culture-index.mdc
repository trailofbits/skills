*From Trail of Bits Skills - Author: Dan Guido*

<essential_principles>

**Culture Index measures behavioral traits, not intelligence or skills. There is no "good" or "bad" profile.**

<principle name="never-compare-absolutes">
**Never compare absolute trait values between people.**

The 0-10 scale is just a ruler. What matters is **distance from the red arrow** (population mean at 50th percentile). The arrow position varies between surveys based on EU.

**Why the arrow moves:** Higher EU scores cause the arrow to plot further right; lower EU causes it to plot further left. This does not affect validity—we always measure distance from wherever the arrow lands.

**Wrong**: "Dan has higher autonomy than Jim because his A is 8 vs 5"
**Right**: "Dan is +3 centiles from his arrow; Jim is +1 from his arrow"

Always ask: Where is the arrow, and how far is the dot from it?
</principle>

<principle name="survey-vs-job">
**Survey = who you ARE. Job = who you're TRYING TO BE.**

> **"You can't send a duck to Eagle school."** Traits are hardwired—you can only modify behaviors temporarily, at the cost of energy.

- **Top graph (Survey Traits)**: Hardwired by age 12-16. Does not change. Writing with your dominant hand.
- **Bottom graph (Job Behaviors)**: Adaptive behavior at work. Can change. Writing with your non-dominant hand.

Large differences between graphs indicate behavior modification, which drains energy and causes burnout if sustained 3-6+ months.
</principle>

<principle name="distance-interpretation">
**Distance from arrow determines trait strength.**

| Distance | Label | Percentile | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|------------|----------------|
| On arrow | Normative | 50th | Flexible, situational |
| ±1 centile | Tendency | ~67th | Easier to modify |
| ±2 centiles | Pronounced | ~84th | Noticeable difference |
| ±4+ centiles | Extreme | ~98th | Hardwired, compulsive, predictable |

**Key insight:** Every 2 centiles of distance = 1 standard deviation.

Extreme traits drive extreme results but are harder to modify and less relatable to average people.
</principle>

<principle name="l-and-i-exception">
**L (Logic) and I (Ingenuity) use absolute values.**

Unlike A, B, C, D, you CAN compare L and I scores directly between people:
- Logic 8 means "High Logic" regardless of arrow position
- Ingenuity 2 means "Low Ingenuity" for anyone

Only these two traits break the "no absolute comparison" rule.
</principle>

</essential_principles>

<input_formats>

**JSON (Use if available)**

If JSON data is already extracted, use it directly:
```python
import json
with open("person_name.json") as f:
    profile = json.load(f)
```

JSON format:
```json
{
  "name": "Person Name",
  "archetype": "Architect",
  "survey": {
    "eu": 21,
    "arrow": 2.3,
    "a": [5, 2.7],
    "b": [0, -2.3],
    "c": [1, -1.3],
    "d": [3, 0.7],
    "logic": [5, null],
    "ingenuity": [2, null]
  },
  "job": { "..." : "same structure as survey" },
  "analysis": {
    "energy_utilization": 148,
    "status": "stress"
  }
}
```

Note: Trait values are `[absolute, relative_to_arrow]` tuples. Use the relative value for interpretation.

Check same directory as PDF for matching `.json` file, or ask user if they have extracted JSON.

**PDF Input (MUST EXTRACT FIRST)**

⚠️ **NEVER use visual estimation for trait values.** Visual estimation has 20-30% error rate.

When given a PDF:
1. Check if JSON already exists (same directory as PDF, or ask user)
2. If not, run extraction with verification:
   ```bash
   uv run plugins/culture-index/scripts/extract_pdf.py --verify /path/to/file.pdf [output.json]
   ```
3. Visually confirm the verification summary matches the PDF
4. Use the extracted JSON for interpretation

**If uv is not installed:** Stop and instruct user to install it (`brew install uv` or `pip install uv`). Do NOT fall back to vision.

**PDF Vision (Reference Only)**

Vision may be used ONLY to verify extracted values look reasonable, NOT to extract trait scores.

</input_formats>

<intake>

**Step 0: Do you have JSON or PDF?**

1. **If JSON provided or found:** Use it directly (skip extraction)
   - Check same directory as PDF for `.json` file with matching name
   - Check if user provided JSON path
2. **If only PDF:** Run extraction script with `--verify` flag
   ```bash
   uv run plugins/culture-index/scripts/extract_pdf.py --verify /path/to/file.pdf [output.json]
   ```
3. **If extraction fails:** Report error, do NOT fall back to vision

**Step 1: What data do you have?**

- **CI Survey JSON** → Proceed to Step 2
- **CI Survey PDF** → Extract first (Step 0), then proceed to Step 2
- **Interview transcript only** → Go to option 8 (predict traits from interview)
- **No data yet** → "Please provide Culture Index profile (PDF or JSON) or interview transcript"

**Step 2: What would you like to do?**

**Profile Analysis:**
1. **Interpret an individual profile** - Understand one person's traits, strengths, and challenges
2. **Analyze team composition** - Assess gas/brake/glue balance, identify gaps
3. **Detect burnout signals** - Compare Survey vs Job, flag stress/frustration
4. **Compare multiple profiles** - Understand compatibility, collaboration dynamics
5. **Get motivator recommendations** - Learn how to engage and retain someone

**Hiring & Candidates:**
6. **Define hiring profile** - Determine ideal CI traits for a role
7. **Coach manager on direct report** - Adjust management style based on both profiles
8. **Predict traits from interview** - Analyze interview transcript to estimate CI traits
9. **Interview debrief** - Assess candidate fit based on predicted traits

**Team Development:**
10. **Plan onboarding** - Design first 90 days based on new hire and team profiles
11. **Mediate conflict** - Understand friction between two people using their profiles

**Provide the profile data (JSON or PDF) and select an option, or describe what you need.**

## Additional References

### Secondary Traits

<overview>

Secondary traits (EU, L, I) supplement the primary traits. L and I are unique: they use **absolute values** and CAN be compared directly between people.

</overview>

<trait name="EU" label="Energy Units">

Measures **mental stamina** - how long a person can work before needing a short 5-10 minute mental break to recharge. If they don't take that break, they operate in a mentally fatigued state (frustrated, lacking clarity, missing things).

<important_note>
EU is NOT:
- Physical energy
- Work ethic
- Intelligence or capability
</important_note>

<interpretation>

| Range | Label | Management Approach |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| 0-10 | **Potentially avoidant** | Flag for review - may need hand-scoring |
| 11-19 | Lower EU | Prioritize important work first thing in morning, earlier in week |
| 20-40 | Most common for executives | Regular short breaks throughout day (4-5 per 10-hour day) |
| 41-60 | Above average | Longer sustained focus possible |
| 61-80 | High ("energizer bunnies") | As mentally fresh at 9pm as 9am; watch for late-night emails |

</interpretation>

<avoidant_responses>

If EU is 0-10, flag for review. Common causes:
1. Didn't read instructions - selected one word per column
2. Interrupted before completing
3. Took survey in non-native language
4. Overly guarded/skeptical - trust issue ("How will this be used against me?")
5. Below 8th grade reading level

**If multiple direct reports return avoidant:** Look at the manager - "Why do you have a culture of fear or mistrust?"

</avoidant_responses>

<energy_drain>

**Critical insight**: Living in your TOP graph (natural traits) does NOT drain EU - it's effortless.

What DRAINS EU is behavior modification - when your bottom graph differs from your top graph, you're expending mental energy to "act" differently than you're wired.

</energy_drain>

<utilization_formula>

**Compare EU between Survey and Job using:**

```
Energy Utilization = (Job EU / Survey EU) × 100
```

| Utilization | Signal | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 70-130% | Healthy | Sustainable workload alignment |
| >130% | **STRESS** | Good stress (self-induced caring) OR bad stress (overutilization). Burnout risk. |
| <70% | **FRUSTRATION** | Disengaged, apathetic, going through motions, underutilized, bored. **Flight risk.** |

**Example**: Survey EU = 41, Job EU = 31. Utilization = 31/41 = 75%. Approaching check-engine-light zone for frustration/disengagement.

</utilization_formula>

<stress_types>

**>130% Stress Types:**
- **Good stress (self-induced)**: "I really care about this company, I love what I do" - but still potential for burnout and health issues if sustained 3-6 months
- **Bad stress (overutilization)**: Loaded with too much work, or work requires too much behavior modification

**<70% Frustration:** Work doesn't quite fit them. Might have a lot to do, but the work doesn't match their traits. Not punching eject yet, but getting close.

</stress_types>

<resurvey_cadence>

Job behaviors should be resurveyed biannually. Don't make decisions on stale data (18+ months old).

</resurvey_cadence>

</trait>

<trait name="L" color="purple" label="Logic">

Measures how a person receives and processes new information - the first filter when receiving new information, especially sensitive information. **Also measures self-esteem** - the lower the logic, the lower the self-esteem.

<important_note>
L uses **absolute values**. You CAN compare L scores directly between people.
Logic 8 means "High Logic" regardless of arrow position.
</important_note>

<interpretation>

| Score | Label | Behavior |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 0-2 | Low Logic | Emotional, sensitive, heartfelt, passionate; emotions filter information first |
| 3-7 | Normative | Emotionally available competency - balanced head and heart working in tandem |
| 8-10 | High Logic | Rational, logical, black/white; high emotional compartmentalization; detach in the moment |

</interpretation>

<low_logic range="0-2">

**Characteristics:**
- Lack emotional control in the moment - first response may be chemically induced, not fact-based
- Introduces unpredictability - irrational in-the-moment decision making
- Can have high self-confidence (A) but low self-esteem simultaneously

**Benefit:** Emotional attachment can drive extraordinary results (Olympians, entrepreneurs)

**Managing Low Logic:**
- Don't say "calm down"
- Create distance - "Let's talk at 4pm today"
- They'll meet you as an adult once emotions settle

</low_logic>

<normative_logic range="3-7">

- Natural EQ - emotionally available but not governed by emotions
- 3-4: Lead more heart than head, but not disconnected from rational thought
- 5: Dead smack in the middle
- 6-7: Lead more head than heart

</normative_logic>

<high_logic range="8-10">

**Characteristics:**
- Clear thinking when things are hitting the fan
- Complete separation from emotions; tough situations don't phase them

**Watch:** Can come across cold, detached, insensitive. "Toughens the dots up."

**Combination note:** High B + Logic 10 = outgoing but can say insensitive things (a bit of an "ahole factor")

**Combination note:** Low B + Logic 10 = "sensitivity is not going to be your strong suit"

</high_logic>

<job_behavior_signal>

When a high logic person (9-10) drops their logic in job behaviors (to 4-5), it's almost always an indication of **people-related challenges**. They're trying to be more emotionally open because they've been told they're too cold/detached.

</job_behavior_signal>

</trait>

<trait name="I" color="cyan" label="Ingenuity">

Measures raw inventiveness and spatial reasoning - how detached from reality someone thinks. "Clever or original thinking."

<important_note>
I uses **absolute values**. You CAN compare I scores directly between people.
Ingenuity 8 means "High Ingenuity" regardless of arrow position.
</important_note>

<interpretation>

| Score | Label | Behavior |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 0-2 | Low Ingenuity | **Most common score**. Linear, practical, grounded. If it doesn't exist, need to touch/see/feel/experience it. |
| 3-6 | Occasional | Occasional moments of inspiration - looking at things in a more layered, original way. |
| 7-10 | High Ingenuity | Ingenious, inventive, eccentric, multidimensional thinkers. Detached from reality. |

</interpretation>

<the_pen_test>

Ask what a pen is:
- Low ingenuity (0-2): "It's a pen."
- High ingenuity (9): "It's how we pump oil in Texas. A window into another world. Executive decision-making. A weapon."
- Low ingenuity response to high ingenuity: "No, moron. It's a freaking pen."

</the_pen_test>

<high_ingenuity range="7-10">

**Where it helps:**
- New business lines and revenue opportunities
- Creative proposals
- R&D
- Creative marketing
- Don't see limitations - experimental, try unconventional approaches

**Watch for:**
- Can be distracting with constant weird ideas
- Not all ideas monetizable - need A trait to commercialize
- Especially disruptive if in position to initiate ideas

</high_ingenuity>

<low_ingenuity range="0-2">

**Most common score.** Not a negative - indicates practical, grounded thinking.

**Note:** Single-tail IQ correlation. High I → likely high IQ. However, low I does NOT mean low IQ - plenty of certified geniuses have low ingenuity scores.

</low_ingenuity>

<job_behavior_signal>

When a low ingenuity person raises their ingenuity in job behaviors, the traditional approach is not working. They're trying to figure out a more inventive way to handle something they're stuck on.

</job_behavior_signal>

</trait>

<confidence_sources>

Culture Index identifies three sources of confidence, each tied to a trait:

| Trait | Confidence Source | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| High A | Inner self-confidence | Belief in self regardless of circumstances. "I believe I'll win." Can be in a hitting slump and picks themselves up by bootstraps. |
| High B | Social confidence | Confidence from ability to influence and connect. If people don't respond, starts questioning self. High A + High B can fall back on A's self-confidence. |
| High D | Knowledge/Expertise confidence | "If I know it, I know it." Confidence rooted in mastery and competency. Great vetters. |

**Confidence recovery:**
- High A's recover by getting back in the winner's circle (stack easy wins)
- High B's recover through relationship reconnection
- High D's recover through acquiring more knowledge/training

</confidence_sources>

### Motivators

<overview>

The simplest way to drive engagement and productivity is to find the leading dot among A, B, D (the three confidence traits) and install motivators for that trait consistently.

</overview>

<motivator_framework>

**Step 1: Find the leading dot** between A, B, and D (the three confidence traits)
**Step 2: Go to that trait's motivator box** (see below)
**Step 3: Install 3-4 of those motivators consistently**

**When dots are stacked** (three confidence traits close together): D always wins - start with D trait motivators first, then B, then A.

**Master level:** Hit motivators for all four primary dots. Takes 2-3 years of practice.

**Retention tip:** Expect to retain ~30% of workshop content initially. Quarterly team discussions with real-life examples help mobilize learning.

### Primary Traits

<overview>

The four primary traits (A, B, C, D) are the main drivers of behavior. The relationship BETWEEN dots is often more important than individual positions. All interpretations are relative to the red arrow (population mean).

</overview>

<trait name="A" color="maroon" label="Autonomy">

Measures **mental initiative** (think and start on their own) and **inner self-confidence** (belief in self that they will win regardless of circumstance).

<high_a side="right">

**Characteristics:**
- Self-confident, self-starter, self-motivated, self-driven, self-reliant
- Assertive, aggressive, ruthlessly competitive
- Future-focused and strategic - sees the full 360-degree lay of the land
- Prioritizes time based on ROI - trades in time and money
- Willing to confront - conflict is just a means to an end
- "Enough equals more" - always raises the bar, never satisfied
- Opinionated - typically thinks they're the smartest person in the room

**Challenges:**
- Single hardest trait to employ - they work for "me, Inc." first
- "You are only RENTING high A's" - need mutually beneficial partnership
- Kryptonite is people - people will consistently disappoint them
- May take matters into their own hands when others "move too slow"
- Can LEAD (vision, strategy) but struggle to MANAGE (routine operations)

**Best Fit Roles:** Leadership, sales, entrepreneurship, strategy

**Communicating with High A's:**
- Use bullet points focused on ROI - they won't read walls of text
- "Bake me a cake" approach: Give outcomes, not step-by-step instructions
- Get buy-in through questions, not statements - let them "own" the idea
- Prefer variable compensation (bonus, equity, commission) over fixed salary

**Who High A's Respect:**
- People ahead of them (mentors, more successful peers)
- People with inner confidence who aren't threatened by them
- NOT people who capitulate or seem "weak"

</high_a>

<low_a side="left">

**Characteristics:**
- Helpful, supportive, service-oriented, accommodating, peaceful
- Servant leadership orientation - "what do WE need to win"
- Tactical and present-focused (vs high A's strategic future-focus)
- Excel at execution once direction is clear
- Team-oriented - finds genuine satisfaction in supporting others' success
- Prefers direction before acting - doesn't initiate on their own

**Challenges:**
- Indecisive with NEW challenges - need frameworks, precedents, or direction
- Conflict averse - may agree to things they don't support to keep peace
- May be put in leadership roles they didn't seek (and will burn out)

**Best Fit Roles:** Support roles, customer service, collaborative teams, execution

**Managing Low A's:**
- Provide specific praise, not general ("Great job on the Johnson proposal")
- Offer consistent, predictable compensation over variable bonuses
- Give clear frameworks for novel decisions
- Don't interpret conflict avoidance as agreement - probe for true concerns

</low_a>

<leadership_styles>

| Style | Trait | Mindset | Characteristics |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| ABL (Action Based Leadership) | High A | "What do I need to win?" | Self-directed, competitive, drives from front |
| WPL (Wolf Pack Leadership) | Low A | "What do WE need to win?" | Collaborative, consensus-building, servant leadership |

Neither is better - depends on context. High-growth/turnaround may need ABL. Stable/complex operations may benefit from WPL.

</trait>


### Team Composition

<overview>

Every team needs the right mix of Gas, Brake, and Glue for its current needs. The ratio depends on the season of business, the function, and current gaps.

</overview>

<gas_brake_glue>

| Role | Trait | Function | Too Little | Too Much |
|------|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Gas Pedal** | High A | Growth, risk-taking, innovation, driving results | Stagnation, waiting around, no decisive action | Chaos, recklessness, burnout |
| **Brake Pedal** | High D | Risk aversion, quality control, compliance, finishing | Erosion, mistakes, lawsuits, quality issues | Paralysis, perfectionism, can't ship |
| **Glue** | High B | Relationships, morale, optimism, "fun part of the zoo" | Root canal culture, morale problems, no fun | All talk, no action, groupthink |

</gas_brake_glue>

<diagnostic_questions>

| Symptom | Likely Gap |
|---------|------------|
| Lacking growth, decisive action, or strategic problem-solving | Not enough high A (Gas) |
| Morale sucks, culture feels like a root canal, no fun | Not enough high B (Glue) |
| Quality erosion, mistakes, compliance issues | Not enough high D (Brake) |
| Chaos, recklessness, burnout, no follow-through | Too much Gas, not enough Brake |
| Paralysis, perfectionism, can't ship anything | Too much Brake, not enough Gas |
| All talk, no action, groupthink, avoiding hard decisions | Too much Glue, not enough Gas |

</diagnostic_questions>

<business_season>

The ideal balance depends on what the team/company needs now:

| Season | Priority | What You Need |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **High-growth / Turnaround** | Gas | Drivers and risk-takers. High A's who will push through. |
| **Consolidation / Stability** | Brake | Quality and consistency. High D's who ensure nothing breaks. |
| **Culture Building** | Glue | Relationship builders. High B's who create positive environment. |
| **Complex Operations** | Brake + Glue | Precision and collaboration. Need both quality control and team cohesion. |
| **Innovation / R&D** | Gas + Low D | Risk-takers who experiment. High A + Low D = willingness to fail fast. |
| **Compliance-Heavy** | Brake | High D's who follow rules precisely. Risk aversion is a feature. |

</business_season>

<function_needs>

Different functions naturally need different balances:

| Function | Primary Need | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| Sales | Gas (High A) | Drive results, close deals, push through objections |
| Engineering | Brake (High D) | Quality code, attention to detail, systematic approach |
| Customer Success | Glue (High B) | Relationships, retention, advocacy |
| Operations | Brake (High D) | Consistency, reliability, process adherence |
| Marketing (Creative) | Gas + Low D | Innovation, experimentation, bold ideas |
| Finance | Brake (High D) | Accuracy, compliance, risk management |
| HR | Glue (High B) | Culture, relationships, employee advocacy |
| Executive Team | Balanced | Need all three: drive (Gas), quality (Brake), culture (Glue) |

</function_needs>

<c_trait_team_impact>

C (Pace/Patience) affects team dynamics beyond Gas/Brake/Glue:

| Team Pattern | Implication |
|--------------|-------------|
| Mostly Low C | Fast-moving, urgent, may create unnecessary chaos. Need someone to slow things down occasionally. |
| Mostly High C | Steady, patient, but may resist change. Need someone to push urgency when required. |
| Mixed C | Natural tension between fast and slow movers. Can be healthy friction if managed. |

**Considerations:**
- If major projects require urgent pivots → need some Low C
- If major projects require sustained focus → need some High C
- Pairing Low C with High C can create complementary partnerships (one pushes, one steadies)

</c_trait_team_impact>

<a_vs_b_team_balance>

Team-wide task vs people orientation:

| Pattern | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| A > B (most people) | Task-focused, results-driven. May neglect relationships and culture. Risk of burnout and turnover. |
| B > A (most people) | People-focused, harmonious. May avoid tough decisions and underperform on results. |
| Mixed A/B | Healthy tension. Task drivers balanced by relationship builders. |

</a_vs_b_team_balance>

<hiring_to_fill_gaps>

When hiring to fill a gap, specify the ideal profile:

**Gap: Not enough Gas**
```
Ideal Hire Pattern:
- A: High (right of arrow) - drives results, takes initiative
- B: Any (based on role) - depends on whether role is people-facing
- C: Low preferred - urgency and pace
- D: Any (consider existing Brake capacity)
```

**Gap: Not enough Brake**
```
Ideal Hire Pattern:
- A: Any - Low A + High D = specialist optimizer
- B: Any (based on role)
- C: High preferred - patience for detailed work
- D: High (right of arrow) - quality focus, follow-through
```

**Gap: Not enough Glue**
```
Ideal Hire Pattern:
- A: Any - Low A + High B = collaborative culture builder
- B: High (right of arrow) - relationship builder
- C: Any (based on role pace)
- D: Any
```

</hiring_to_fill_gaps>

<conflict_pairs>

Trait combinations that create friction on teams:

| Combination | Friction Point | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| High A vs High A | Power struggles, both want to lead | Clear role delineation, separate domains |
| High A vs Low A | Independence vs collaboration | High A provides direction, respects Low A's process |
| High B vs Low B | Social needs mismatch | High B allows Low B alone time; Low B participates minimally |
| High C vs Low C | Pace/urgency mismatch | Low C respects focus time; High C accepts some urgency |
| High D vs Low D | Detail orientation clash | High D accepts "good enough"; Low D follows through |
| High D vs High D | Both perfectionist, both critical | Can be excellent partnership if aligned on standards |

</conflict_pairs>

<remote_team_considerations>

For remote/distributed teams:

- **Glue is even more critical** - Without casual office interactions, High B's are essential for maintaining culture
- **Low B's thrive** - Remote work is natural for those who prefer isolation
- **Low C's may struggle** - Harder to get immediate responses, may feel urgency isn't matched
- **High D's need clear processes** - More documentation, explicit SOPs for remote work

</remote_team_considerations>

**All four primary dots near the arrow = "Chameleon"**

- Statistically average across all traits
- Unpublished pattern making up less than 0.57% of population
- Maximum flexibility but may lack strong, predictable drivers
- Hard to pin down - adapts to situations

</chameleon_pattern>

<pattern_width>

The spread between traits matters as much as individual positions.

**Wide pattern** (traits spread far apart):
- More extreme, predictable behaviors
- Stronger drivers
- Easier to predict day-to-day behavior

**Narrow pattern** (traits clustered):
- More moderate, flexible behaviors
- Less predictable
- Can adapt to situations

Two people can have identical A positions but vastly different overall patterns due to B/C/D spread.

</pattern_width>

<pattern_fit_warning>

**Flight risk signal**: When someone's Job behaviors show the opposite of their Survey traits.

Example: Architect pattern (High A, Low C, Low D) → Socializer in job (Low A, High B, High C, Low D)
- All dots flipped to opposite side
- This is imminent flight risk
- Something must change or they will leave

</pattern_fit_warning>

<role_fit_questions>

When determining what pattern fits a role, ask:

| Question | Left Answer | Right Answer | Relevant Trait |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Is this role more **macro** or **micro**? | Micro (details, execution) | Macro (big picture, strategy) | A trait |
| Is this position more about **people skills** or **problem solving**? | Problem solving | People skills | B trait |
| How much **repetition** is in this role? | Low repetition, chaos, variety | High repetition, stability, predictable | C trait |

**Use these to match patterns:**
- Macro + people + variety = High A, High B, Low C (Rainmaker/Persuader)
- Micro + problem solving + stability = Low A, Low B, High C, High D (Craftsman/Specialist)
- Macro + problem solving + stability = High A, Low B, High C, High D (Scholar/Architect)

</role_fit_questions>

<identifying_pattern>

**Quick interpretation method:**

1. Find the farthest dot from the normative line (highest deviation)
2. Identify which range it falls into:
   - ±2 centiles = "somewhat" or "very" (one standard deviation)
   - ±4 centiles = "extremely" (entering six-sigma territory)
3. Use word descriptors from the appropriate column

**Example**: D trait is 4.5 centiles right of the norm = "extremely conforming perfectionist, precise, cautious, accurate."

**For dots on or near the line** (±0.5): "Situationally, depending on your level of comfort and experience, you might be [right-side words] or [left-side words]."

</identifying_pattern>


### Interview Trait Signals

<overview>

This reference helps predict Culture Index traits from interview transcripts. Candidates don't take CI during interviews - these signals help estimate traits before the actual survey is administered after an offer is signed.

**Important caveats:**
- Predictions are estimates, not definitive assessments
- Interview context affects behavior (stress, performance mode)
- Always note confidence level for each trait
- Actual CI survey will confirm or correct predictions

</overview>

<trait_signals>

<autonomy_a label="Autonomy (A) Signals">

**High A indicators (right of arrow):**
- Uses "I" frequently: "I decided...", "I built...", "I led..."

<pattern_combinations>

Look for trait combinations that suggest patterns:

| Signal Cluster | Likely Pattern |
|----------------|----------------|
| High A + Low B + rapid pace + big-picture | Architect/Visionary |
| High A + High B + rapid pace | Rainmaker/Persuader |
| Low B + deliberate pace + precise | Scholar/Specialist |
| Low A + High B + deliberate | Accommodator |
| Low A + Low B + precise | Technical Expert |

</pattern_combinations>

<transcript_analysis_tips>

**When analyzing transcripts:**

1. **Count language patterns** - "I" vs "we", precise vs approximate
2. **Note energy shifts** - What topics animate them? What topics flatten them?
3. **Watch for consistency** - Same signals across different questions?
4. **Consider context** - Technical questions vs behavioral questions
5. **Flag uncertainties** - Note where evidence is weak

**Red flags for confidence:**
- Candidate clearly in "interview mode" (performing)
- Very short interview (insufficient data)
- Interviewer dominated conversation
- Technical-only questions (limited behavioral data)

</transcript_analysis_tips>

</output_format>


### Anti Patterns

<overview>

Common mistakes when interpreting Culture Index profiles. Avoiding these errors is as important as understanding the methodology itself.

</overview>

<interpretation_mistakes>

<mistake name="comparing-absolutes">

**Comparing absolute trait values between people**

**Wrong:** "Dan has higher autonomy than Jim because his A is 8 vs 5"

**Right:** "Dan is +3 centiles from his arrow; Jim is +1 from his arrow"

**Why it's wrong:** The arrow position varies between surveys based on EU. An 8 with an arrow at 6 is only +2 from norm. A 5 with an arrow at 2 is +3 from norm.

**Only exception:** L and I use absolute values and CAN be compared directly.

</mistake>

<mistake name="ignoring-arrow">

**Ignoring the red arrow position**

The arrow is the population mean (50th percentile). All interpretation must be relative to it.

**Wrong:** "This person has low B (score of 3)"

**Right:** "This person's B is 2 centiles left of their arrow, indicating pronounced introversion"

</mistake>

<mistake name="value-judgments">

**Treating traits as "good" or "bad"**

Culture Index measures behavioral traits, not value or capability.

**Wrong:**
- "High D is good because they're detail-oriented"
- "Low B is bad because they're not social"

**Right:**
- "High D indicates strong attention to detail - fits roles requiring precision"
- "Low B indicates preference for focused work - fits analytical roles"

There is no universally "good" profile. Fit depends on role, team, and context.

</mistake>

<mistake name="stale-data">

**Using outdated data (18+ months old)**

Job behaviors update as environment, leadership, or projects change. Stale data leads to wrong conclusions.

**Best practice:** Resurvey job behaviors every 6 months, especially after major role or leadership changes.

</mistake>

<mistake name="single-trait-focus">

**Over-indexing on a single trait**

The pattern (relationship between traits) matters more than any individual dot.

**Wrong:** "They have High A, so they're a leader"

**Right:** "High A combined with High D suggests they can build new systems. High A with Low D suggests they'll drive fast but may miss details."

</mistake>

<mistake name="ignoring-survey-vs-job">

**Not comparing Survey vs Job graphs**

Missing burnout signals by only looking at one graph.

**Always check:**
- Did the arrow move? (Stress/Frustration signal)
- Did any dots flip sides? (Polarizing shift - flight risk)
- What's the EU utilization? (>130% stress, <70% frustration)

</mistake>

<mistake name="confusing-traits-behaviors">

**Confusing traits with behaviors**

Survey (top) = hardwired traits (who you ARE)
Job (bottom) = adaptive behaviors (who you're TRYING TO BE)

Traits don't change. Behaviors can be modified temporarily - but at an energy cost.

**"You can't send a duck to Eagle school."** - You can train behaviors, not traits.

</mistake>

</interpretation_mistakes>

<application_mistakes>

<mistake name="seeking-homogeneity">

**Hiring for homogeneous teams**

Hiring people who match the manager's profile creates blind spots.

**Better approach:** Build diverse teams with complementary traits. Every team needs Gas (High A), Brake (High D), and Glue (High B) in appropriate proportions.

</mistake>

<mistake name="overloading-high-a">

**Overloading on High A's**

High A's are "the single hardest trait to employ." They work for "me, Inc." first.

Too many High A's = power struggles, lack of follow-through, no one to execute.

**You are only RENTING High A's** - they need a mutually beneficial partnership.

</mistake>

<mistake name="neglecting-brake">

**Neglecting the Brake (High D)**

Every team needs quality control, risk management, and follow-through.

Without Brake: Erosion, mistakes, lawsuits, quality issues, things start but never finish.

</mistake>

<mistake name="assuming-fit-permanent">

**Assuming job fit is permanent**

People's roles evolve. Business needs change. What fit yesterday may not fit tomorrow.

Regular check-ins (resurvey every 6 months) catch misalignment before it becomes burnout or turnover.

</mistake>

<mistake name="using-ci-alone">

**Using Culture Index as the only data point**

Culture Index is ONE tool among many. It measures behavioral traits, not:
- Skills or competencies
- Intelligence
- Experience
- Values
- Motivation

**Best practice:** Use CI alongside interviews, references, skills assessments, and performance data.

</mistake>

</application_mistakes>

<communication_mistakes>

<mistake name="sharing-raw-scores">

**Sharing raw scores without context**

Telling someone "Your A is 8" without explaining relative position is meaningless and potentially harmful.

**Always communicate:**
- Position relative to arrow
- What that means behaviorally
- Why it's neither good nor bad
- How it fits (or doesn't) with their role

</mistake>

<mistake name="labeling-people">

**Using CI to label or box people**

CI shows tendencies, not destiny.

**Wrong:** "You're a Persuader, so you should only do sales"

**Right:** "Your pattern shows strengths in influence and relationship building. How do you use those in your current role?"

</mistake>

<mistake name="public-comparison">

**Comparing profiles publicly**

Never compare individuals' profiles in group settings without their consent.

Discussing "Person A is more detail-oriented than Person B" creates hierarchy and judgment.

</mistake>

</communication_mistakes>

<red_flags>

**Signals that suggest deeper investigation:**

| Signal | What to Check |
|--------|---------------|
| EU 0-10 (avoidant response) | Was survey completed properly? Trust issues? |
| All dots on or near arrow | Chameleon pattern - less than 0.57% of population. Verify validity. |
| Job behaviors completely opposite of Survey | Imminent flight risk. What's causing this extreme modification? |
| EU utilization > 150% | Severe stress. Immediate conversation needed. |
| EU utilization < 50% | Severe disengagement. May have already mentally quit. |
| D raised significantly in Job behaviors | Most common unsustainable stress pattern. Why do they feel they need to be so much more perfectionist? |

</red_flags>

<checklist>

**Before finalizing any interpretation:**

- [ ] Did I use relative positions (distance from arrow)?
- [ ] Did I avoid calling any trait "good" or "bad"?
- [ ] Did I compare Survey vs Job if both available?
- [ ] Did I calculate EU utilization?
- [ ] Did I consider the full pattern, not just leading traits?
- [ ] Is my data current (less than 18 months old)?
- [ ] Did I note that CI is one data point among many?

</checklist>

<rationalization_table>

**Common excuses that indicate you're about to make a CI interpretation mistake:**

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Their A is higher so they're more autonomous" | Compare distance from arrow, not absolute values |
| "This is a bad profile for leadership" | No bad profiles - fit depends on role and context |
| "They need to change their C trait" | Survey traits are hardwired - change the environment instead |
| "Low B means they're not a team player" | Low B means they prefer focused work - they can still collaborate |
| "High D is always good for quality" | High D without other traits can mean paralysis and rigidity |
| "They should be more like their manager" | Different profiles bring complementary strengths |
| "This pattern can't do that job" | Patterns indicate tendencies, not hard limits |
| "Their EU is fine, the job is the problem" | EU tells you about energy, not about job design |
| "I remember their profile from last year" | Resurvey Job behaviors every 6 months - they change |
| "The arrow doesn't matter, just look at the dots" | The arrow IS the reference point - dots mean nothing without it |
| "L and I work the same as A, B, C, D" | L and I use absolute values, primary traits are relative |
| "Survey and Job will be the same" | Survey = hardwired, Job = adaptive. They often differ. |
| "High A means they're selfish" | High A means they're self-directed - not the same thing |
| "We need all High A's on this high-growth team" | You're renting High A's, and they'll clash with each other |
| "This hire looks good, skip the CI" | CI is one data point - use it WITH other assessments, not instead of |

### Extract From Pdf

# Extract from PDF Workflow

Extract Culture Index profile data from a PDF file and convert to JSON format.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- `uv` - Install with `brew install uv` or `pip install uv`
- `poppler` - Install with `brew install poppler` (macOS) or `apt install poppler-utils` (Ubuntu)
- `tesseract` - Install with `brew install tesseract` (macOS) or `apt install tesseract-ocr` (Ubuntu)

## Extraction Command

Single command, no setup required:

```bash
uv run plugins/culture-index/scripts/extract_pdf.py --verify /path/to/profile.pdf
```

**Options:**
- `--verify`, `-v` - Show verification summary for spot-checking (recommended)
- Second argument - Output path for JSON (optional, defaults to stdout)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Extract with verification (recommended)
uv run plugins/culture-index/scripts/extract_pdf.py --verify profile.pdf

# Extract and save to file
uv run plugins/culture-index/scripts/extract_pdf.py profile.pdf output.json

# Extract and pipe to jq
uv run plugins/culture-index/scripts/extract_pdf.py profile.pdf | jq '.survey'
```

## What Happens

1. `uv` creates a temporary environment with all Python dependencies (PEP 723)
2. Script extracts trait values using OpenCV (100% accuracy)
3. With `--verify`, displays summary table for manual confirmation
4. Outputs JSON to stdout or specified file

## Verification Summary

When using `--verify`, you'll see ASCII charts that match the PDF layout:

**Spot-check against the PDF:**
- Each trait row: Is the ● in roughly the same position as the dot on the PDF?
- Arrow position: Does ↑ align with the red arrow on each chart?
- EU values: Match what's displayed on the PDF?

## If Extraction Fails

- **"uv not found"** → Install uv: `brew install uv`
- **"poppler not found"** → Install poppler: `brew install poppler`
- **"tesseract not found"** → Install tesseract: `brew install tesseract`

**Do NOT fall back to visual estimation.** Fix the dependency issue instead. Visual estimation has 20-30% error rate.

```

## After Extraction

Proceed to the appropriate workflow:
- Individual interpretation: `workflows/interpret-individual.md`
- Burnout detection: `workflows/detect-burnout.md`
- Team analysis: `workflows/analyze-team.md`


### Compare Profiles

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files before comparing:**
1. `references/primary-traits.md` - Trait details
2. `references/secondary-traits.md` - L and I interpretation

</required_reading>

<process>

**Step 1: Load Both Profiles**

For each person, record:
- Name
- Pattern/Archetype
- Arrow position
- All trait distances from arrow (A, B, C, D)
- L and I absolute values
- EU values

**Step 2: Create Comparison Table**

| Trait | Person A Distance | Person B Distance | Difference | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| A | +/- X from arrow | +/- X from arrow | | |
| B | +/- X from arrow | +/- X from arrow | | |
| C | +/- X from arrow | +/- X from arrow | | |
| D | +/- X from arrow | +/- X from arrow | | |
| L | [absolute] | [absolute] | | |
| I | [absolute] | [absolute] | | |

**Remember**: Compare DISTANCES from arrow, not absolute values (except L and I).

**Step 3: Identify Similar Traits**

Traits where both people fall on the same side of their arrow (both high or both low):

- [Trait]: Both high/low - [implication]

Similarity creates:
- Shared understanding
- Similar communication style
- Potential blind spots (both miss same things)

**Step 4: Identify Opposite Traits**

Traits where people fall on opposite sides of their arrows:

- [Trait]: Person A high, Person B low - [implication]

Opposites create:
- Potential friction
- Complementary strengths (if managed well)
- Need for intentional bridging

**Step 5: Assess Major Friction Points**

| Combination | Friction | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| High A vs Low A | Independence expectations clash | High A gives direction, respects Low A's collaborative needs |
| High B vs Low B | Social needs mismatch | High B allows Low B alone time; Low B tolerates some small talk |
| High C vs Low C | Pace mismatch | Low C respects High C's focus time; High C accepts some urgency |
| High D vs Low D | Detail orientation clash | High D accepts "good enough"; Low D follows through on commitments |

Document specific friction points for this pair.

**Step 6: Assess Communication Compatibility**

| Person A | Person B | Communication Challenge |
|----------|----------|-------------------------|
| High A | Low A | High A may steamroll; Low A may not push back |
| High B | Low B | High B needs verbal processing; Low B prefers written |
| High C | Low C | High C needs advance notice; Low C creates urgency |
| High D | Low D | High D wants specifics; Low D gives big picture |

**Step 7: Compare L (Logic) and I (Ingenuity)**

These use absolute values - direct comparison is valid.

**Logic comparison:**
| Person A Logic | Person B Logic | Dynamic |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Both High (8-10) | Both High (8-10) | Rational discussions, may seem cold to others |
| Both Low (0-2) | Both Low (0-2) | Emotional connection, may escalate together |
| One High, One Low | - | Potential misunderstanding; High L may dismiss Low L's concerns |

**Ingenuity comparison:**
| Person A Ingenuity | Person B Ingenuity | Dynamic |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Both High (7-10) | Both High (7-10) | Creative brainstorming, may lack grounding |
| Both Low (0-2) | Both Low (0-2) | Practical focus, may miss innovative solutions |
| One High, One Low | - | High I may frustrate Low I with abstract ideas |

**Step 8: Identify Complementary Strengths**

Where opposites create value:

- Person A brings [trait/strength], Person B brings [trait/strength]
- Together they cover [gap that neither would alone]

Example:
- High A (Person A) + High D (Person B) = "A starts, D finishes"
- High B (Person A) + Low B (Person B) = "One builds relationships, one does deep work"

**Step 9: Leadership/Collaboration Dynamics**

If one person leads the other:

| Leader Trait | Follower Trait | Dynamic |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| High A leading Low A | Works well if High A provides direction |
| Low A leading High A | High A may not respect, may take over |
| High D leading Low D | Low D may feel micromanaged |
| Low D leading High D | High D may feel unsupported |

**Step 10: Compile Comparison Summary**

```

```

</process>

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these comparison mistakes:

- **Comparing absolute values**: "Person A has a 7, Person B has a 4" is meaningless
- **Assuming same = better**: Opposite traits often create complementary value
- **Ignoring context**: Collaboration needs depend on the work being done
- **Overlooking L and I**: These ARE comparable directly and affect dynamics
- **Binary thinking**: It's not "compatible" or "incompatible" - it's about managing dynamics

</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>

Profile comparison is complete when:
- [ ] Both profiles loaded with arrow positions
- [ ] All traits compared using relative distances
- [ ] Similarities identified with implications
- [ ] Differences identified with friction risks
- [ ] L and I compared directly

### Coach Manager

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files before coaching:**
1. `references/primary-traits.md` - A, B, C, D trait details and management approaches
2. `references/secondary-traits.md` - EU, L, I traits
3. `references/patterns-archetypes.md` - Pattern identification

</required_reading>

<purpose>

Help managers work more effectively with their direct reports by comparing Culture Index profiles and providing specific coaching recommendations. This workflow translates trait differences into actionable management adjustments.

</purpose>

<process>

**Step 1: Load Both Profiles**

Gather the manager and direct report's profiles:

```
Manager: [Name]
- Pattern: [Archetype]
- A: [position relative to arrow]
- B: [position relative to arrow]
- C: [position relative to arrow]
- D: [position relative to arrow]
- EU Survey/Job: [values]

Direct Report: [Name]
- Pattern: [Archetype]
- A: [position relative to arrow]
- B: [position relative to arrow]
- C: [position relative to arrow]
- D: [position relative to arrow]
- EU Survey/Job: [values]
```

**Step 2: Calculate Trait Gaps**

For each trait, calculate the gap between manager and direct report:

| Trait | Manager | Direct Report | Gap | Friction Risk |
|-------|---------|---------------|-----|---------------|
| A | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [Low/Med/High] |
| B | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [Low/Med/High] |
| C | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [Low/Med/High] |
| D | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [Low/Med/High] |

**Friction risk guide:**
- Same side of arrow, similar distance: Low friction
- Same side of arrow, different distance: Medium friction
- Opposite sides of arrow: High friction potential

**Step 3: Identify Primary Friction Points**

Flag the largest gaps (opposite sides of arrow or >3 centile difference):

| Gap | Manager Tendency | Direct Report Need | Friction Source |
|-----|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [Trait] | [behavior] | [behavior] | [conflict] |

**Common friction patterns:**

| Manager | Direct Report | Friction |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| High A | Low A | Manager expects initiative; report waits for direction |
| Low A | High A | Manager collaborates; report acts independently |
| High B | Low B | Manager wants connection; report wants to work |
| Low B | High B | Manager skips rapport; report needs relationship first |
| High C | Low C | Manager methodical; report impatient |
| Low C | High C | Manager creates urgency; report resists rush |
| High D | Low D | Manager detail-focused; report big-picture |
| Low D | High D | Manager flexible; report needs structure |

**Step 4: Generate Communication Adjustments**

Based on direct report's traits, recommend specific adjustments:

**If direct report is High A:**
- Use bullet points focused on ROI, not paragraphs
- Give outcomes ("bake me a cake"), not step-by-step instructions
- Ask questions to get buy-in, don't dictate
- Allow autonomy - avoid micromanagement
- Be direct and confident - they don't respect hesitation

**If direct report is Low A:**
- Provide specific direction before expecting action
- Give frameworks for novel decisions
- Offer specific praise, not general ("Great job on X")
- Probe for concerns - silence doesn't mean agreement
- Don't misread helpfulness as ambition

**If direct report is High B:**
- Allow time for rapport before tasks
- Verbal praise and public recognition matter
- Include in social activities
- Don't isolate with extended solo work
- Remember: first statement isn't final position (verbal processor)

**If direct report is Low B:**
- Minimize unnecessary check-ins
- Use async communication (email) over meetings
- Private recognition, not public praise
- Thoughtful gestures over verbal affirmation
- Don't mistake quiet for disengagement

**If direct report is High C:**
- Send agendas in advance
- One topic per meeting
- Protect their focus time (28-min recovery from interruptions)
- Provide advance notice of changes
- Give structured, sequential instructions

**If direct report is Low C:**
- Put deadlines in subject lines
- Keep them busy with variety
- Expect them to interrupt - plan for it
- Use their urgency productively
- Don't be surprised by over-commitment

**If direct report is High D:**
- Frame feedback as process improvement, not personal criticism
- Provide training/learning opportunities
- Don't break trust - they have long memories
- Build SOPs for new responsibilities
- Recognize their attention to quality

**If direct report is Low D:**
- Give creative problems to solve
- Provide options, not mandates
- Build systems to catch their gaps
- Focus on the 3 things that matter most
- Accept 80% completion; assign finishers

**Step 5: Design 1:1 Structure**

Based on trait comparison, recommend 1:1 format:

**Frequency:**
- Low A direct report: More frequent (weekly)
- High A direct report: Less frequent (bi-weekly or as needed)
- High C direct report: Consistent schedule, same time/day
- Low C direct report: Flexible timing, short check-ins ok

**Duration:**
- High B direct report: Allow buffer for rapport
- Low B direct report: Keep focused and efficient
- High C direct report: Single-topic, predictable length
- Low C direct report: Can be shorter, faster-paced

**Format:**
- High D direct report: Structured agenda, action items
- Low D direct report: Flexible, allow tangents
- High B direct report: Start with personal connection
- Low B direct report: Start with business

**Sample 1:1 template for [Direct Report's Pattern]:**
```
1. [Opening based on B trait]
2. [Agenda item structure based on C/D traits]
3. [Feedback approach based on A trait]
4. [Closing/action items based on D trait]
```

**Step 6: Identify Motivators**

Based on direct report's profile, their primary motivators are:

| Trait Position | Motivator | Implementation |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| High A | Autonomy, ROI, winning | Give ownership, variable comp |
| Low A | Clear direction, team success | Specific praise, stable comp |
| High B | Acceptance, inclusion | Verbal praise, team activities |
| Low B | Privacy, focus time | Leave alone, private recognition |
| High C | Stability, predictability | Consistent routines, advance notice |
| Low C | Variety, deadlines | Keep busy, clear deadlines |
| High D | Knowledge, trust | Training, recognition for quality |
| Low D | Freedom, options | Creative problems, flexibility |

**Step 7: Flag Energy Concerns**

Check EU utilization:
- Survey EU: [value]
- Job EU: [value]
- Utilization: [Job/Survey × 100]%

| Utilization | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| 70-130% | Healthy | Maintain current approach |
| <70% | Frustration | Address mismatch - discuss role engagement |
| >130% | Stress | Direct report is overextending |

**Step 8: Compile Coaching Summary**

```markdown
## Manager Coaching Guide: [Manager] → [Direct Report]

**Date:** [Date]
**Manager Pattern:** [Archetype]
**Direct Report Pattern:** [Archetype]

### Key Trait Gaps
| Trait | Gap | Adjustment Needed |
|-------|-----|-------------------|
| [Trait] | [difference] | [specific adjustment] |

### Communication Style Adjustments
1. [Specific adjustment based on their traits]
2. [Specific adjustment based on their traits]
3. [Specific adjustment based on their traits]

### 1:1 Recommendations
- **Frequency:** [recommendation]

2. [Motivator 2] - [how to implement]

### Watch Areas
- [Potential friction point 1]

- [Anti-pattern for this direct report]
```

</process>

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these coaching mistakes:

- **Expecting them to change**: Survey traits are hardwired - change the environment, not the person
- **Projecting your motivators**: What motivates you may demotivate them
- **One-size-fits-all 1:1s**: Adapt format to their profile
- **Ignoring EU signals**: Low utilization predicts disengagement and flight risk
- **Treating gaps as problems**: Different profiles bring complementary strengths
- **Forgetting your own biases**: Your profile affects how you perceive theirs

</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>

Manager coaching is complete when:
- [ ] Both profiles loaded and compared
- [ ] All trait gaps calculated with friction risk
- [ ] Primary friction points identified
- [ ] Communication adjustments specified for each major trait
- [ ] 1:1 structure designed for their profile
- [ ] Motivators identified with implementation suggestions
- [ ] EU utilization checked and flagged if concerning
- [ ] Watch areas documented
- [ ] Anti-patterns for this pairing noted

</success_criteria>


### Mediate Conflict

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files before mediation:**
1. `references/primary-traits.md` - A, B, C, D trait details
2. `references/team-composition.md` - Conflict pairs and friction patterns
3. `references/patterns-archetypes.md` - Pattern identification

</required_reading>

<purpose>

Understand why two team members aren't working well together using their Culture Index profiles. This workflow identifies trait-based friction sources and provides specific recommendations for improving the working relationship.

**Important:** CI explains behavioral friction, not personal conflict. If the conflict involves values, ethics, or performance issues, those require separate intervention.

</purpose>

<process>

**Step 1: Load Both Profiles**

```
Person A: [Name]
- Role: [Title]
- Pattern: [Archetype]
- A: [position relative to arrow]
- B: [position relative to arrow]
- C: [position relative to arrow]
- D: [position relative to arrow]
- EU Survey/Job: [values]

Person B: [Name]
- Role: [Title]
- Pattern: [Archetype]
- A: [position relative to arrow]
- B: [position relative to arrow]
- C: [position relative to arrow]
- D: [position relative to arrow]
- EU Survey/Job: [values]
```

**Step 2: Map Trait Differences**

Calculate the gap for each trait:

| Trait | Person A | Person B | Gap | On Same Side? |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|---------------|
| A | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [Yes/No] |
| B | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [Yes/No] |
| C | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [Yes/No] |
| D | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [Yes/No] |

**Highest friction risk:** Traits on opposite sides of arrow with large gaps.

**Step 3: Identify Primary Friction Source**

Match trait gaps to known friction patterns:

| Pattern | Source | How It Manifests |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| **High A vs Low A** | Independence vs collaboration | High A acts autonomously; Low A feels excluded. Low A seeks consensus; High A sees it as slow. |
| **High A vs High A** | Power struggle | Both want to lead, neither wants to defer. Competing visions. |
| **High B vs Low B** | Social energy mismatch | High B wants connection; Low B wants focus. High B feels rejected; Low B feels overwhelmed. |
| **High C vs Low C** | Pace mismatch | Low C creates urgency; High C resists rush. High C seems slow; Low C seems chaotic. |
| **High D vs Low D** | Detail orientation | High D focuses on precision; Low D on big picture. High D sees carelessness; Low D sees rigidity. |
| **High D vs High D** | Perfectionism clash | Both critical, both notice flaws. Can become mutual criticism spiral. |

**Your primary friction source:** [Identified pattern]

**Step 4: Understand Each Perspective**

Map how each person likely perceives the other:

**Person A ([Pattern]) likely sees Person B as:**

| Person A's Trait | Person B's Trait | Person A Perceives B As... |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| High A | Low A | Indecisive, slow, passive |
| Low A | High A | Aggressive, selfish, dismissive |
| High B | Low B | Cold, unfriendly, disconnected |
| Low B | High B | Chatty, distracting, inefficient |
| High C | Low C | Chaotic, impatient, disruptive |
| Low C | High C | Slow, resistant, inflexible |
| High D | Low D | Sloppy, unreliable, careless |
| Low D | High D | Rigid, nitpicky, controlling |

**Person B ([Pattern]) likely sees Person A as:**
[Same analysis from B's perspective]

**Step 5: Assess Relationship Structure**

What is their working relationship?

| Relationship | Additional Dynamics |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Peers | No hierarchy - must find middle ground |
| Manager → Report | Manager should adapt first (they have more power) |
| Report → Manager | Report may need environment change if mismatch is severe |
| Cross-functional | Different priorities compound trait friction |
| Close collaborators | Daily friction accumulates faster |
| Occasional interaction | May be able to limit contact |

**Their relationship:** [Type]

**Step 6: Generate Mediation Approach**

Based on friction source, recommend approach:

**For High A vs Low A friction:**
- Clarify decision rights (who owns what)
- High A: Give Low A explicit input time before decisions
- Low A: Understand High A's autonomy need isn't personal
- Process: Defined consultation points before independent action

**For High B vs Low B friction:**
- Acknowledge different social needs
- High B: Reduce expectations for social interaction from Low B
- Low B: Commit to minimal connection (brief check-ins)
- Process: Scheduled, bounded social interaction

**For High C vs Low C friction:**
- Acknowledge pace difference as legitimate
- Low C: Give advance notice of urgent requests
- High C: Accept some urgency is real, build buffer time
- Process: Deadlines set with High C's processing time in mind

**For High D vs Low D friction:**
- Acknowledge different detail orientations
- High D: Accept "good enough" for some work
- Low D: Use systems to catch critical details
- Process: Clear quality standards for each deliverable type

**For High A vs High A friction:**
- Clear domain ownership (separate turfs)
- Explicit agreement on shared decisions
- Regular alignment to prevent divergent directions
- Process: Leadership defines who owns what

**Your mediation approach:**
1. [Specific recommendation]
2. [Specific recommendation]
3. [Specific recommendation]

**Step 7: Design Process Changes**

Beyond individual adjustments, what process changes would help?

| Friction Source | Process Solution |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Pace mismatch | Define response time expectations, meeting cadence |
| Decision friction | RACI or decision rights matrix |
| Communication style | Agree on preferred channels, formats |
| Detail orientation | Define quality gates and checklists |
| Social needs | Protected focus time vs collaboration time |

**Recommended process changes:**
1. [Specific process change]
2. [Specific process change]

**Step 8: Identify What Won't Change**

CI traits are hardwired. Set realistic expectations:

| Person | Trait | Will Not Change |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| [Name] | [trait] | [behavior that won't change] |
| [Name] | [trait] | [behavior that won't change] |

**Accept that:**
- [Person A] will continue to [trait-driven behavior]
- [Person B] will continue to [trait-driven behavior]

The goal is accommodation, not transformation.

**Step 9: Check Energy Levels**

Review EU utilization for both parties:

| Person | EU Survey | EU Job | Utilization | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| [A] | [val] | [val] | [%] | [Healthy/Stress/Frustration] |
| [B] | [val] | [val] | [%] | [Healthy/Stress/Frustration] |

**If either is in stress/frustration:**
- The conflict may be intensifying natural friction
- Address the energy drain as part of mediation
- Consider workload or role adjustment

**Step 10: Compile Mediation Summary**

```markdown
## Conflict Analysis: [Person A] & [Person B]

**Date:** [Date]
**Relationship:** [Peers / Manager-Report / etc.]

### Profile Comparison

| Trait | Person A | Person B | Gap |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|
| A | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] |
| B | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] |
| C | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] |
| D | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] |

**Person A Pattern:** [Archetype]
**Person B Pattern:** [Archetype]

### Primary Friction Source
**[Identified pattern]**

[1-2 sentence explanation of the core conflict driver]

### How They See Each Other

**Person A likely perceives Person B as:**
- [perception based on trait gap]

**Person B likely perceives Person A as:**
- [perception based on trait gap]

### Recommendations

**For Person A:**
1. [Specific adjustment]
2. [Specific adjustment]

**For Person B:**
1. [Specific adjustment]
2. [Specific adjustment]

**Process Changes:**
1. [Process change to reduce friction]
2. [Process change to reduce friction]

### What Won't Change
- [Person A] will continue to [trait behavior] - this is hardwired
- [Person B] will continue to [trait behavior] - this is hardwired

The goal is accommodation, not transformation.

### Energy Status
- Person A: [EU utilization status]
- Person B: [EU utilization status]

[Note any energy concerns]

### Conversation Guide

**Frame the discussion as:**
- Different working styles, not personal conflict
- Both approaches are valid
- Goal is finding workable middle ground

**Avoid:**
- Labeling either person's style as "wrong"
- Expecting either to fundamentally change
- Assuming one must adapt more than the other (unless manager-report)

### Success Indicators
After mediation, look for:
- [ ] Reduced friction in [specific interaction type]
- [ ] Both parties feeling heard
- [ ] Workable process in place for [friction point]
- [ ] Energy levels stabilizing (if previously stressed)

### Escalation Criteria
Escalate beyond CI-based mediation if:
- Conflict involves values, ethics, or harassment
- Performance issues underlie the conflict
- Either party is unwilling to accommodate
- Energy utilization continues declining
```

</process>

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these mediation mistakes:

- **Blaming one party**: Both profiles contribute to friction
- **Expecting transformation**: CI traits don't change - environment does
- **Ignoring power dynamics**: Manager-report relationships require manager to adapt first
- **Over-attributing to CI**: Not all conflict is trait-based
- **Generic advice**: Recommendations must be specific to their trait gaps
- **Forgetting EU signals**: Energy drain indicates escalating friction

</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>

Conflict mediation is complete when:
- [ ] Both profiles loaded and compared
- [ ] All trait gaps calculated
- [ ] Primary friction source identified
- [ ] Each person's perspective mapped
- [ ] Relationship structure considered
- [ ] Specific recommendations for each person
- [ ] Process changes identified
- [ ] Hardwired behaviors acknowledged (won't change)
- [ ] EU levels checked
- [ ] Conversation guide provided
- [ ] Success indicators defined
- [ ] Escalation criteria noted

</success_criteria>


### Define Hiring Profile

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files before defining a hiring profile:**
1. `references/patterns-archetypes.md` - Pattern identification and role-fit questions
2. `references/primary-traits.md` - A, B, C, D trait details

</required_reading>

<purpose>

Define the ideal Culture Index profile for a role you're hiring. This workflow helps translate job requirements into specific trait positions, identify acceptable patterns, and flag red flags.

</purpose>

<process>

**Step 1: Gather Role Context**

Collect information about the position:

```
Role: [Title]
Reports To: [Manager's pattern if known]
Team Context: [Existing team profiles if available]
Business Stage: [Growth / Consolidation / Turnaround / Stability]
```

**Step 2: Answer Role-Fit Questions**

These three questions determine primary trait positions:

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Is this role more **macro** or **micro**? | Macro → High A | Micro → Low A |
| Is this position more about **people** or **problems**? | People → High B | Problems → Low B |
| How much **repetition** is in this role? | High repetition → High C | Low repetition → Low C |

**Record your answers:**
- Macro/Micro: [answer] → A should be [High/Low/Normative]
- People/Problems: [answer] → B should be [High/Low/Normative]
- Repetition level: [answer] → C should be [High/Low/Normative]

**Step 3: Determine D Trait (Conformity)**

Ask additional questions:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Does this role require strict adherence to process? | High D | Low D |
| Are details and precision critical to success? | High D | Low D |
| Will quality failures have significant consequences? | High D | Low D |
| Does the role require creative rule-breaking? | Low D | - |
| Must they challenge status quo to succeed? | Low D | - |

**Record:** D should be [High/Low/Normative]

**Step 4: Map to Ideal Pattern**

Using your answers from Steps 2-3, identify the ideal pattern:

| Role Profile | Trait Combination | Example Roles |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Visionary/Architect** | High A, Low C, Low D | CEO, Founder, Strategy Lead |
| **Rainmaker/Persuader** | High A, High B, Low C | Sales, BD, Account Executive |
| **Scholar/Specialist** | Low B, High C, High D | Engineer, Analyst, Researcher |
| **Technical Expert** | Low A, Low B, Low C, High D | Security, QC, Operations |
| **Craftsman** | Low A, Low B, High C, High D | Finance, Compliance, Audit |
| **Accommodator** | Low A, High B, High C | HR, Customer Success, Support |
| **Philosopher** | High A, Low B, High C | Strategy, Research |

**Your ideal pattern:** [Pattern name]

**Step 5: Define Acceptable Range**

Not every hire will be a perfect match. Define acceptable variance:

| Trait | Ideal | Acceptable Range | Hard No |
|-------|-------|------------------|---------|
| A | [High/Low/Norm] | [range] | [extremes to avoid] |
| B | [High/Low/Norm] | [range] | [extremes to avoid] |
| C | [High/Low/Norm] | [range] | [extremes to avoid] |
| D | [High/Low/Norm] | [range] | [extremes to avoid] |

**Guidance for ranges:**
- "Must have": ±1 centile from ideal
- "Strongly prefer": ±2 centiles from ideal
- "Acceptable": ±3 centiles from ideal
- "Hard no": Beyond ±4 centiles

**Step 6: Consider L and I**

Logic (L) and Ingenuity (I) use absolute values:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Does this role require detached, analytical decision-making? | High L (7-10) | - |
| Does this role require empathy and emotional intelligence? | Low L (0-3) | - |
| Does this role require novel problem-solving and innovation? | High I (7-10) | - |
| Does this role benefit from proven methods over invention? | Low I (0-3) | - |

**Record:**
- L: [range or "any"]
- I: [range or "any"]

**Step 7: Identify Role-Specific Red Flags**

Based on role requirements, flag patterns that would struggle:

| If the role requires... | Red flag pattern | Why |
|-------------------------|------------------|-----|
| Independent decision-making | Very Low A | Needs direction, avoids decisions |
| Customer interaction | Very Low B | May seem cold or disengaged |
| Steady, predictable work | Very Low C | Creates unnecessary urgency |
| Precision and accuracy | Very Low D | Misses details, inconsistent |
| Quick pivots | Very High C | Resists change, slow to adapt |
| Creative solutions | Very High D | Rigid adherence to process |
| Collaboration | Very High A | "Me first," dismissive of others |

**Your red flags:**
1. [Pattern/trait that would fail in this role]
2. [Pattern/trait that would fail in this role]

**Step 8: Consider Team Dynamics**

If team profiles are available:

| Current Team Gap | Hire For |
|------------------|----------|
| No High A (lacking "Gas") | Consider High A |
| No High B (lacking "Glue") | Consider High B |
| No High D (lacking "Brake") | Consider High D |
| All same pattern | Add diversity |
| Existing friction | Avoid intensifying |

**Team consideration notes:** [observations]

**Step 9: Generate Hiring Profile**

Compile the complete hiring profile:

```markdown
## Hiring Profile: [Role Title]

**Date Created:** [Date]
**Created By:** [Name]

### Role Context
- Reports to: [Manager pattern if known]
- Team: [Team composition summary]
- Business stage: [Growth/Consolidation/etc.]

### Ideal Profile

| Trait | Position | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------|-------|
| A (Autonomy) | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | [reason] |
| B (Social) | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | [reason] |
| C (Pace) | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | [reason] |
| D (Conformity) | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | [reason] |
| L (Logic) | [range or any] | [H/M/L] | [reason] |
| I (Ingenuity) | [range or any] | [H/M/L] | [reason] |

**Target Pattern:** [Pattern name]

### Acceptable Alternatives
- [Alternative pattern 1] - [why acceptable]
- [Alternative pattern 2] - [why acceptable]

### Red Flags (Do Not Hire)
1. [Pattern/trait] - [why problematic for this role]
2. [Pattern/trait] - [why problematic for this role]

### Interview Focus Areas
Based on the ideal profile, explore these areas in interviews:
- [Area 1 based on required traits]
- [Area 2 based on required traits]

### Using This Profile

**With predicted traits (from interview transcript):**
- Compare predicted profile to this template
- Note areas of alignment and concern
- Flag any red flag traits in predicted profile

**With actual CI survey (after offer signed):**
- Compare actual survey to predictions
- Assess fit against this profile
- Identify onboarding considerations based on gaps
```

</process>

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these hiring profile mistakes:

- **Over-specifying**: Requiring exact positions reduces candidate pool unnecessarily
- **Cloning existing team**: Different patterns bring valuable perspectives
- **Ignoring business stage**: Growth needs Gas, consolidation needs Brake
- **Using CI as sole filter**: Profile is one input, not the complete picture
- **Treating traits as skills**: CI measures drives, not capabilities
- **Dismissing normative traits**: Flexibility can be a strength

</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>

Hiring profile is complete when:
- [ ] Role context documented (reporting, team, stage)
- [ ] All three role-fit questions answered
- [ ] D trait determined with rationale
- [ ] Ideal pattern identified
- [ ] Acceptable ranges defined for all traits
- [ ] L and I requirements specified (or marked as "any")

- Candidates have been interviewed but haven't taken the CI survey yet
- You want preliminary trait estimates before extending an offer
- You want to compare predicted vs actual CI (after offer is signed)

**Important:** This produces predictions, not diagnoses. The actual CI survey will be administered after an offer is signed and before the start date.

</purpose>

<process>

**Step 1: Load the Transcript**

Request the interview transcript. Ideal format includes:
- Interviewer questions clearly marked
- Candidate responses clearly marked
- Timestamps or durations (helpful but not required)
- Multiple interviews if available (more data = higher confidence)

**Step 2: Initial Read-Through**

First pass - get overall impression:
- How does the candidate communicate?
- What's their energy level?
- What topics engage them most?
- What's their default communication style?

Note your initial gut sense before detailed analysis.

**Step 3: Analyze A (Autonomy) Signals**

Search transcript for:

| Look For | High A | Low A |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Pronouns | "I decided", "I built" | "We decided", "Our team" |
| Credit | Takes personal credit | Deflects to team |
| Questions | Reframes, pushes back | Asks for clarification |

| Decision-making | Evidence-based | Intuition-based |

**Record:**
- Score estimate: 0-10
- Confidence: High / Medium / Low
- Key quotes (1-2 examples)

**Step 8: Analyze I (Ingenuity) - Absolute Scale**

Search transcript for:

| Look For | High I (7-10) | Low I (0-2) |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Problem-solving | Novel approaches | Proven methods |
| Assumptions | Questions, challenges | Accepts, follows |
| Examples | Original, creative | Standard, textbook |
| Routine | Mentions boredom | Describes comfort |

**Record:**
- Score estimate: 0-10
- Confidence: High / Medium / Low
- Key quotes (1-2 examples)

**Step 9: Identify Pattern**

Based on trait positions, identify likely pattern:

Cross-reference with `references/patterns-archetypes.md`:

| If you see... | Likely pattern |
|---------------|----------------|
| High A, Low B, Low C, Low D | Architect/Visionary |
| High A, High B, Low C | Rainmaker/Persuader |
| Low A, Low B, High C, High D | Scholar/Specialist |
| Low A, High B, High C | Accommodator |
| Low A, Low B, Low C, High D | Technical Expert |

**Only identify pattern if confidence is sufficient** - if traits are unclear, note "insufficient data for pattern identification."

**Step 10: Flag Uncertainty Areas**

Document where evidence is weak:
- Traits with only 1-2 data points
- Traits that showed inconsistent signals
- Topics that weren't covered in interview
- Signs of "interview mode" performance

**Step 11: Generate Predicted Profile**

Output using this structure:

```markdown
## Predicted Culture Index Profile: [Candidate Name]

**Analysis Date:** [Date]
**Transcript Source:** [Interview type, duration, interviewers]
**Overall Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]

### Trait Predictions

| Trait | Predicted | Confidence | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| A (Autonomy) | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| B (Social) | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| C (Pace) | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| D (Conformity) | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| L (Logic) | [0-10] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| I (Ingenuity) | [0-10] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |

### Predicted Pattern
**[Pattern Name]** (if identifiable)

[1-2 sentence description of what this pattern means]

### Strongest Signals
1. [Most clear trait signal with quote]
2. [Second clearest signal with quote]

### Uncertainty Areas
- [Trait/area where more data needed]
- [Trait/area where signals were mixed]

### Interview Context Notes
- [Any factors that may have affected behavior]
- [Signs of interview performance mode]

### Caveats
- This is a prediction based on interview behavior, not a CI survey result
- Interview stress may affect natural behavior patterns
- Actual CI survey will be administered after offer acceptance
- Use for preliminary assessment only - do not treat as definitive
```

</process>

<verification>

Before finalizing prediction:

1. **Did I cite specific quotes?** Every trait prediction needs evidence
2. **Did I note confidence levels?** Every trait needs H/M/L confidence
3. **Did I flag uncertainties?** Where is evidence weak?
4. **Did I include caveats?** Predictions are not diagnoses
5. **Did I avoid over-confidence?** Especially for low-data traits

</verification>

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these prediction mistakes:

- **Over-interpreting single quotes**: One example isn't a pattern
- **Ignoring interview context**: Stress affects behavior
- **Treating predictions as definitive**: This is hypothesis, not diagnosis
- **Skipping low-confidence traits**: Better to say "uncertain" than guess
- **Assuming consistency**: Interview behavior may differ from daily behavior
- **Forgetting to cite evidence**: Every claim needs a quote

</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>

Transcript analysis is complete when:
- [ ] All 6 traits analyzed with position/score estimates
- [ ] Each trait has confidence level (H/M/L)
- [ ] Each trait has supporting quotes from transcript
- [ ] Pattern identified (if sufficient confidence)
- [ ] Uncertainty areas documented
- [ ] Caveats clearly stated
- [ ] Output follows standard format

</success_criteria>


### Interview Debrief

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files before debrief:**
1. `references/patterns-archetypes.md` - Pattern identification and role fit
2. `references/team-composition.md` - Gas/Brake/Glue framework
3. `workflows/predict-from-interview.md` - How predictions were generated
4. `workflows/define-hiring-profile.md` - If hiring profile exists

</required_reading>

<purpose>

Evaluate a candidate's predicted Culture Index profile against role requirements and team composition. This workflow helps make informed hiring decisions using transcript-predicted traits, with appropriate caveats about prediction confidence.

**Important:** This uses PREDICTED traits from interview analysis, not actual CI survey results. The actual survey will be administered after offer acceptance. Use this for preliminary assessment only.

</purpose>

<process>

**Step 1: Load Predicted Profile**

Gather the prediction from transcript analysis:

```
Candidate: [Name]
Analysis Date: [Date]
Interview Source: [Interview type, duration]

Predicted Traits:
| Trait | Predicted | Confidence | Key Evidence |
|-------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| A | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| B | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| C | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| D | [High/Low/Norm] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| L | [0-10] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |
| I | [0-10] | [H/M/L] | "[Quote]" |

Predicted Pattern: [Pattern name]
Overall Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
```

**Step 2: Load Role Requirements**

If a hiring profile exists, load it. Otherwise, answer the role-fit questions:

| Question | Answer | Required Trait |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Macro or micro? | [answer] | A: [High/Low/Norm] |
| People or problems? | [answer] | B: [High/Low/Norm] |
| Repetition level? | [answer] | C: [High/Low/Norm] |
| Process adherence? | [answer] | D: [High/Low/Norm] |

**Target Pattern:** [Pattern name]
**Red Flags for Role:** [traits that would struggle]

**Step 3: Compare Predicted vs Required**

| Trait | Predicted | Required | Match | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| A | [pred] | [req] | [Y/N/~] | [concern if any] |
| B | [pred] | [req] | [Y/N/~] | [concern if any] |
| C | [pred] | [req] | [Y/N/~] | [concern if any] |
| D | [pred] | [req] | [Y/N/~] | [concern if any] |
| L | [pred] | [req] | [Y/N/~] | [concern if any] |
| I | [pred] | [req] | [Y/N/~] | [concern if any] |

**Match key:**
- Y = Strong match (same direction, similar magnitude)
- ~ = Acceptable (within tolerance)
- N = Mismatch (opposite direction or extreme gap)

**Step 4: Check Against Red Flags**

Compare predicted traits to role red flags:

| Red Flag | Predicted | Hit? | Severity |
|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| [trait/pattern] | [prediction] | [Y/N] | [High/Med/Low] |

**Red flag hits:** [count]

**Step 5: Assess Team Fit**

If team profiles are available:

**Current Team Composition:**
- Gas (High A): [count] people
- Brake (High D): [count] people
- Glue (High B): [count] people

**Would this candidate add:**
- [ ] Needed Gas (High A)?
- [ ] Needed Brake (High D)?
- [ ] Needed Glue (High B)?
- [ ] Diversity of perspective?

**Potential team friction:**
- [Candidate trait] vs [Team member trait]: [friction risk]

**Step 6: Assess Manager Fit**

If hiring manager's profile is known:

| Trait | Manager | Candidate (Predicted) | Gap |
|-------|---------|----------------------|-----|
| A | [pos] | [pred] | [diff] |
| B | [pos] | [pred] | [diff] |
| C | [pos] | [pred] | [diff] |
| D | [pos] | [pred] | [diff] |

**Predicted working relationship:**
- [Alignment or friction point 1]
- [Alignment or friction point 2]

**Step 7: Weight Confidence Levels**

Calculate weighted assessment based on prediction confidence:

| Factor | Assessment | Confidence Weight | Weighted |
|--------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Role fit | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [H/M/L → 3/2/1] | [score] |
| Team fit | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [H/M/L → 3/2/1] | [score] |
| Red flag hits | [None/Some/Multiple] | [H/M/L → 3/2/1] | [score] |
| Manager fit | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [H/M/L → 3/2/1] | [score] |

**Important confidence caveats:**
- Low confidence traits: May change significantly when actual CI is administered
- Medium confidence: Directionally correct but magnitude uncertain
- High confidence: Likely accurate, but interview stress may have affected

**Step 8: Generate Recommendation**

Based on weighted assessment:

| Overall Fit | Recommendation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Strong fit, high confidence | **Proceed** | Extend offer, plan for CI survey |
| Strong fit, low confidence | **Proceed with note** | Extend offer, flag traits to verify |
| Moderate fit | **Proceed with awareness** | Extend offer, prepare for onboarding adjustments |
| Weak fit, concerns | **Discuss** | Review concerns with hiring team |
| Red flag hits | **Pause** | Additional interviews or reconsider |

**Step 9: Compile Debrief Summary**

```markdown
## Interview Debrief: [Candidate Name]

**Date:** [Date]
**Role:** [Position]
**Prediction Source:** [Interview type, duration]
**Overall Prediction Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]

### Predicted Profile Summary
| Trait | Predicted | Confidence |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| A | [pos] | [H/M/L] |
| B | [pos] | [H/M/L] |
| C | [pos] | [H/M/L] |
| D | [pos] | [H/M/L] |

**Predicted Pattern:** [Pattern]

### Fit Assessment

**Role Fit:** [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
- [Key alignment or concern]

**Team Fit:** [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
- [Key alignment or concern]

**Manager Fit:** [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
- [Key alignment or concern]

### Red Flags
- [Red flag 1, if any]
- [Red flag 2, if any]

### Recommendation
**[Proceed / Proceed with Note / Discuss / Pause]**

[1-2 sentence rationale]

### Areas to Verify with Actual CI
When the actual Culture Index survey is administered (after offer acceptance), verify:
1. [Trait with lower confidence]
2. [Trait that's critical for role]
3. [Any predicted trait that was borderline]

### If Hired: Onboarding Considerations
Based on predicted profile:
- [Onboarding consideration 1]
- [Onboarding consideration 2]

### Caveats
- This assessment uses predicted traits from interview analysis
- Interview behavior may differ from natural behavior
- Actual CI survey will be sent after offer acceptance
- Predictions should inform, not determine, hiring decisions
- Technical skills, experience, and cultural interview still matter
```

</process>

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these debrief mistakes:

- **Treating predictions as facts**: Low confidence predictions may be wrong
- **Over-weighting CI fit**: Skills, experience, and culture interview matter too
- **Automatic rejection on red flags**: Consider severity and role criticality
- **Ignoring interview performance**: CI predicts drives, not capabilities
- **Comparing to non-existent ideal**: No candidate is a perfect match
- **Forgetting the actual survey is coming**: Use predictions for preliminary assessment only

</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>

Interview debrief is complete when:
- [ ] Predicted profile loaded with confidence levels
- [ ] Role requirements documented (from hiring profile or role-fit questions)
- [ ] Predicted vs required comparison completed
- [ ] Red flags checked

- [ ] Manager fit assessed (if manager profile available)
- [ ] Confidence weighting applied
- [ ] Clear recommendation generated
- [ ] Areas to verify with actual CI identified

</success_criteria>


### Detect Burnout

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files before analyzing:**
1. `references/primary-traits.md` - Understanding trait movement
2. `references/anti-patterns.md` - Burnout warning signs

</required_reading>

<process>

**Step 1: Load Both Charts**

You need both Survey (top) and Job (bottom) graphs for burnout detection.

Record for each chart:
- Arrow position
- All trait values (A, B, C, D, L, I)
- EU value

**Step 2: Calculate Energy Utilization**

```
Utilization = (Job EU / Survey EU) × 100
```

| Utilization | Status | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 70-130% | Healthy | Sustainable workload |
| >130% | **STRESS** | Overutilization, burnout risk |
| <70% | **FRUSTRATION** | Underutilization, flight risk |

**Example**: Survey EU = 41, Job EU = 54 → 54/41 = 132% → STRESS

**Step 3: Compare Arrow Movement**

| Arrow Direction (Survey → Job) | Signal | Meaning |
|--------------------------------|--------|---------|
| Arrow shifts RIGHT | STRESS | Pushing harder than natural |
| Arrow shifts LEFT | FRUSTRATION | Pulling back, disengaging |
| Arrow position unchanged | Stable | Environment matches expectations |

**Step 4: Analyze Each Trait's Movement**

For each trait, compare Survey position to Job position:

| Trait | Survey | Job | Movement | Signal |
|-------|--------|-----|----------|--------|
| A | ? | ? | +/- ? | ? |
| B | ? | ? | +/- ? | ? |
| C | ? | ? | +/- ? | ? |
| D | ? | ? | +/- ? | ? |
| L | ? | ? | +/- ? | ? |
| I | ? | ? | +/- ? | ? |

**Movement interpretation:**

| Trait | Raising | Dropping |
|-------|---------|----------|
| A | Needs to drive/lead more (may be self-induced or required) | Being held back ("Who/what is blocking you?") |
| B | Role requires more relationship building | Role isolates them (demotivating if naturally high B) |
| C | More focus/patience required than comfortable | More urgency/variety required than comfortable |
| D | Expected to be more perfectionist/accountable | Role allows more flexibility |
| L | Trying to be more emotional/open | Compartmentalizing emotions at work |
| I | Trying to be more inventive (traditional approach not working) | Focusing on practical execution |

**Step 5: Identify Polarizing Shifts**

**Critical flag**: When a dot moves from one side of the norm to the other.

Example: D moves from 2nd percentile (left) to 91st percentile (right)
- This is drastic behavior modification
- Almost certainly not sustainable

Document any polarizing shifts:
- [Trait]: Moved from [side] to [opposite side]
- Severity: [moderate/severe]

**Step 6: Check for "Opposite Pattern" Warning**

**Imminent flight risk signal**: When someone's Job behaviors show the opposite of their Survey traits.

Example: Architect (High A, Low C, Low D) → Socializer (Low A, High B, High C) in job
- All dots flipped to opposite side
- This person is in severe stress
- Something must change or they will leave

**Step 7: Identify Stress Sources**

Job behaviors reflect perception of what the role requires. Sources:
1. **Their leader** - Manager expectations/communication
2. **The work itself** - Actual responsibilities
3. **Coworkers** - People they work with

Ask: "Why do they perceive they need to behave this way?"

**Step 8: Calculate 3-6 Month Risk**

If behavior modification continues 3-6+ months, expect:
- Burnout and stress
- Disengagement
- Low morale
- "Mailing it in" (70% effort when capable of 100%)

Assess: How long has this modification been sustained?

**Step 9: Check D Trait Specifically**

D movement is the most common stress indicator:

| D Movement | Signal |
|------------|--------|
| Raising D significantly | Expected to be more perfectionist/accountable than natural |
| D "polarizing" (low to high) | Most common source of unsustainable stress |

**Step 10: Compile Burnout Assessment**

```
## Burnout Risk Assessment: [Name]

### Energy Utilization
- Survey EU: [X]
- Job EU: [X]
- Utilization: [X]%
- Status: [HEALTHY / STRESS / FRUSTRATION]

### Arrow Movement
- Survey arrow: [X]
- Job arrow: [X]
- Direction: [Right=Stress / Left=Frustration / Stable]

### Trait Movement Summary
| Trait | Survey | Job | Change | Concern Level |
|-------|--------|-----|--------|---------------|
| A | | | | Low/Medium/High |
| B | | | | Low/Medium/High |
| C | | | | Low/Medium/High |
| D | | | | Low/Medium/High |

### Polarizing Shifts
- [Any traits that flipped sides]

### Risk Level: [LOW / MODERATE / HIGH / CRITICAL]

### Stress Sources (Likely)
1. [Source 1]
2. [Source 2]

### Recommended Actions
1. [Action 1 - e.g., "Discuss workload with manager"]
2. [Action 2 - e.g., "Resurvey in 3 months"]
3. [Action 3 - e.g., "Consider role adjustment"]

### Timeline
- Current duration estimate: [X months]
- Risk horizon: [When burnout likely if unchanged]
```

</process>

<stress_types>

**>130% (STRESS) has two types:**

1. **Good stress (self-induced)**: "I love this company, I care deeply"
   - Still burnout risk if sustained
   - Health issues possible after 3-6 months

2. **Bad stress (overutilization)**: Too much work OR work requires too much behavior modification
   - More urgent intervention needed
   - May need workload or role adjustment

**<70% (FRUSTRATION):**

- Work doesn't fit their traits
- May have lots to do, but work doesn't match who they are
- Not punching eject yet, but getting close
- Flight risk if not addressed

</stress_types>

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these burnout detection mistakes:

- **Ignoring small EU differences**: Even 10-15% over 130% matters
- **Focusing only on EU**: Trait movement matters too
- **Dismissing "good stress"**: Self-induced stress still causes burnout
- **Using stale data**: Job behaviors should be resurveyed every 6 months
- **Not asking why**: Understand the source before recommending solutions

</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>

Burnout detection is complete when:
- [ ] Both Survey and Job data analyzed
- [ ] EU utilization calculated
- [ ] Arrow movement identified
- [ ] All trait movements documented
- [ ] Polarizing shifts flagged
- [ ] Risk level assigned (Low/Moderate/High/Critical)
- [ ] Stress sources identified
- [ ] Specific recommendations provided
- [ ] Timeline/horizon assessed

</success_criteria>


### Analyze Team

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files before analyzing:**
1. `references/team-composition.md` - Gas/Brake/Glue framework
2. `references/patterns-archetypes.md` - Pattern identification

</required_reading>

<process>

**Step 1: Load All Team Profiles**

Gather profiles for all team members. For each person, you need:
- Name
- Pattern/Archetype
- Trait distances from arrow (A, B, C, D)
- EU values (Survey and Job)

**Step 2: Categorize Gas/Brake/Glue**

For each team member, identify their primary role:

| Role | Trait | Who Qualifies |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **Gas** | High A (right of arrow) | Drives growth, takes risks, initiates |
| **Brake** | High D (right of arrow) | Controls quality, manages risk, finishes |
| **Glue** | High B (right of arrow) | Builds culture, maintains morale, connects |

Create a team roster:

| Name | Pattern | Primary Role | Secondary Role |
|------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| ? | ? | Gas/Brake/Glue | ? |

**Step 3: Assess Balance**

Count roles:
- Gas (High A): [X] people
- Brake (High D): [X] people
- Glue (High B): [X] people

**Balance indicators:**

| Symptom | Likely Gap |
|---------|------------|
| Lacking growth, decisive action, strategic problem-solving | Not enough Gas (High A) |
| Morale issues, root canal culture, no fun | Not enough Glue (High B) |
| Quality erosion, mistakes, compliance issues | Not enough Brake (High D) |
| Chaos, recklessness, burnout | Too much Gas, not enough Brake |
| Paralysis, perfectionism, can't ship | Too much Brake, not enough Gas |
| All talk, no action, groupthink | Too much Glue, not enough Gas |

**Step 4: Consider Business Season**

The ideal balance depends on what the team/company needs now:

| Season | Priority | Emphasis |
|--------|----------|----------|
| High-growth / Turnaround | Gas | Need drivers and risk-takers |
| Consolidation / Stability | Brake | Need quality and consistency |
| Culture Building | Glue | Need relationship builders |
| Complex Operations | Brake + Glue | Need precision and collaboration |

**Step 5: Identify Gaps**

Based on balance assessment:

```
Current State:
- Gas: [X] (sufficient/insufficient)
- Brake: [X] (sufficient/insufficient)
- Glue: [X] (sufficient/insufficient)

Gap Analysis:
- [Gap 1]: [Description and impact]
- [Gap 2]: [Description and impact]
```

**Step 6: Check C Trait Distribution**

C (Pace/Patience) affects team dynamics:

| Pattern | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Mostly Low C | Fast-moving, urgent, may create chaos |
| Mostly High C | Steady, patient, may resist change |
| Mixed C | Natural tension between fast and slow |

If major projects require urgent pivots → need some Low C.
If major projects require sustained focus → need some High C.

**Step 7: Review A vs B Balance**

Team-wide task vs people orientation:

| Pattern | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| A > B (most people) | Task-focused, results-driven, may neglect relationships |
| B > A (most people) | People-focused, harmonious, may avoid tough decisions |
| Mixed | Healthy tension, can balance both |

**Step 8: Flag Potential Conflicts**

Trait combinations that create friction:

| Combination | Friction Point |
|-------------|----------------|
| High A vs Low A | Independence vs collaboration expectations |
| High B vs Low B | Social needs mismatch |
| High C vs Low C | Pace/urgency mismatch |
| High D vs Low D | Detail orientation mismatch |

Identify specific pairs who may clash.

**Step 9: Recommend Hires (if gaps exist)**

For each gap, specify ideal profile:

```
Gap: [Missing role]
Ideal Hire: [Pattern type]
- A: [high/low/normative] - [reason]
- B: [high/low/normative] - [reason]
- C: [high/low/normative] - [reason]
- D: [high/low/normative] - [reason]
```

**Step 10: Compile Team Analysis**

```
## Team Composition Analysis

### Team Roster
[Table of members with patterns and roles]

### Balance Assessment
- Gas (High A): [count] - [assessment]
- Brake (High D): [count] - [assessment]
- Glue (High B): [count] - [assessment]

### Current Gaps
1. [Gap and impact]
2. [Gap and impact]

### Potential Friction Points
- [Person A] vs [Person B]: [reason]

### Hiring Recommendations
1. [Role needed]: [Pattern to seek]

### Team Strengths
1. [Strength 1]
2. [Strength 2]

### Watch Areas
1. [Risk 1]
2. [Risk 2]
```

</process>

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these team analysis mistakes:

- **Seeking homogeneity**: Teams need diverse profiles, not clones
- **Over-indexing on Gas**: High A's are hard to manage and may conflict
- **Ignoring Brake**: Every team needs quality control and follow-through
- **Neglecting Glue in remote teams**: High B's are critical for culture
- **Using absolute values**: Always use distance from arrow for A, B, C, D

</anti_patterns>

<success_criteria>

Team analysis is complete when:
- [ ] All team members categorized by Gas/Brake/Glue
- [ ] Balance assessed with specific counts
- [ ] Business season considered
- [ ] Gaps identified with impact
- [ ] C trait distribution reviewed
- [ ] A vs B balance assessed
- [ ] Potential conflicts flagged
- [ ] Hiring recommendations provided (if gaps exist)
- [ ] Team strengths documented
- [ ] Watch areas identified

</success_criteria>


### Plan Onboarding

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files before planning onboarding:**
1. `references/primary-traits.md` - A, B, C, D trait details and communication styles
2. `references/team-composition.md` - Gas/Brake/Glue and conflict pairs
3. `references/patterns-archetypes.md` - Pattern identification

</required_reading>

<purpose>

Plan effective onboarding for a new hire using their Culture Index profile and the team's profiles. This workflow identifies likely allies, potential friction points, and provides specific recommendations for the first 90 days.

**Context:** This workflow is typically used after the new hire has signed their offer and completed the CI survey, but before their start date.

</purpose>

<process>

**Step 1: Load New Hire Profile**

```
New Hire: [Name]
Start Date: [Date]
Role: [Title]
Reports To: [Manager name]

Profile:
- Pattern: [Archetype]
- A: [position relative to arrow]
- B: [position relative to arrow]
- C: [position relative to arrow]
- D: [position relative to arrow]
- L: [absolute value]
- I: [absolute value]
- EU Survey: [value]
```

**If comparing to predicted profile (from interview):**
| Trait | Predicted | Actual | Delta |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| A | [pred] | [actual] | [diff] |
| B | [pred] | [actual] | [diff] |
| C | [pred] | [actual] | [diff] |
| D | [pred] | [actual] | [diff] |

Note any significant differences for onboarding planning.

**Step 2: Load Team Profiles**

List immediate team members:

| Name | Pattern | A | B | C | D | Role |
|------|---------|---|---|---|---|------|
| [Manager] | [pattern] | [pos] | [pos] | [pos] | [pos] | Manager |
| [Peer 1] | [pattern] | [pos] | [pos] | [pos] | [pos] | [role] |
| [Peer 2] | [pattern] | [pos] | [pos] | [pos] | [pos] | [role] |

**Team Composition:**
- Gas (High A): [count] people
- Brake (High D): [count] people
- Glue (High B): [count] people

**Step 3: Identify Natural Allies**

Find team members with compatible profiles:

**High compatibility indicators:**
- Similar pattern/archetype
- Similar B position (social energy match)
- Similar C position (pace match)
- Complementary traits (their strength helps their gap)

| Team Member | Compatibility | Reason |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| [Name] | High | [trait similarity or complement] |
| [Name] | Medium | [partial match] |

**Recommended buddy/mentor:**
- Primary: [Name] - [reason for pairing]
- Secondary: [Name] - [reason for backup]

**Step 4: Flag Potential Friction Points**

Find team members with opposite profiles:

| Team Member | Friction Risk | Source | Mitigation |
|-------------|---------------|--------|------------|
| [Name] | High | [opposite trait] | [suggestion] |
| [Name] | Medium | [gap] | [suggestion] |

**Common friction sources:**
- High A vs Low A: Independence vs collaboration expectations
- High B vs Low B: Social needs mismatch
- High C vs Low C: Pace/urgency mismatch
- High D vs Low D: Detail orientation mismatch

**Step 5: Manager Compatibility Assessment**

Compare new hire to their manager:

| Trait | Manager | New Hire | Gap | Adjustment Needed |
|-------|---------|----------|-----|-------------------|
| A | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [manager adjustment] |
| B | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [manager adjustment] |
| C | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [manager adjustment] |
| D | [pos] | [pos] | [diff] | [manager adjustment] |

**Manager coaching points:**
- [Specific adjustment for this new hire]
- [Specific adjustment for this new hire]

**Step 6: Design First 30 Days**

Based on new hire's profile:

**Week 1 - Orientation:**

| If New Hire Is... | Orientation Approach |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| High A | Give autonomy early, avoid over-managing, focus on outcomes |
| Low A | Provide clear direction, structured intro, defined expectations |
| High B | Introduce to team quickly, social activities, relationships first |
| Low B | Gradual introductions, 1:1 over group, respect alone time |
| High C | Predictable schedule, one thing at a time, advance notice |
| Low C | Variety early, multiple projects, don't over-structure |
| High D | Documented processes, clear SOPs, training materials |
| Low D | Big picture context, creative problems, flexibility |

**Your Week 1 approach:**
- [Specific recommendation based on their traits]
- [Specific recommendation based on their traits]
- [Specific recommendation based on their traits]

**Weeks 2-4 - Integration:**

| Priority | Action | Why (based on profile) |
|----------|--------|------------------------|
| 1 | [action] | [trait-based reason] |
| 2 | [action] | [trait-based reason] |
| 3 | [action] | [trait-based reason] |

**Step 7: Design 30-60 Days**

| Focus Area | Approach for This Profile |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Feedback style | [Based on A and D traits] |
| Meeting cadence | [Based on B and C traits] |
| Project type | [Based on I and pattern] |
| Independence level | [Based on A trait] |
| Check-in format | [Based on B and C traits] |

**Milestones to target:**
- Day 30: [milestone appropriate for their pattern]
- Day 45: [milestone appropriate for their pattern]
- Day 60: [milestone appropriate for their pattern]

**Step 8: Design 60-90 Days**

At this stage, focus on:

| If New Hire Is... | 60-90 Day Focus |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| High A | Expand scope, give ownership of projects |
| Low A | Establish regular collaboration patterns |
| High B | Integrate into team social fabric, culture building |
| Low B | Ensure solo time is protected, deep work established |
| High C | Consistent routines established, predictable workflow |
| Low C | Multiple concurrent projects, varied work |
| High D | Mastery of key processes, becoming the expert |
| Low D | Creative challenges, problem-solving opportunities |

**Success indicators by Day 90:**
- [ ] [Indicator appropriate for their pattern]
- [ ] [Indicator appropriate for their pattern]
- [ ] [Indicator appropriate for their pattern]

**Step 9: Prepare Manager Briefing**

Create a one-page briefing for the manager:

```markdown

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these onboarding mistakes:

- **One-size-fits-all onboarding**: Adjust approach based on their traits
- **Ignoring manager compatibility**: Manager adjustments are critical for retention
- **Assigning random buddies**: Match based on profile compatibility
- **Over-socializing Low B's**: Respect their need for alone time
- **Under-socializing High B's**: Include them quickly or they'll feel excluded
- **Rushing High C's**: Give them time to settle into routines
- **Boring Low C's**: Keep them engaged with variety
- **Surprising High D's**: Provide structure and documentation

</anti_patterns>

### Interpret Individual

<required_reading>

**Read these reference files before interpreting:**
1. `references/primary-traits.md` - A, B, C, D trait details
2. `references/secondary-traits.md` - EU, L, I traits
3. `references/patterns-archetypes.md` - Pattern identification

</required_reading>

<process>

**Step 1: Load the Profile**

For JSON:
```python
import json
with open("path/to/profile.json") as f:
    profile = json.load(f)
```

For PDF: **Extract first** using the extraction script:
```bash
uv run plugins/culture-index/scripts/extract_pdf.py --verify /path/to/profile.pdf
```

⚠️ **NEVER use visual estimation for trait values.** Visual estimation has 20-30% error rate.

**Step 1b: Verify Extraction (if from PDF)**

After extraction, review the verification summary and briefly spot-check against the PDF image:
- [ ] EU values match what's displayed on each chart
- [ ] Arrow position looks correct
- [ ] Most extreme trait (shown in summary) makes visual sense

If any value seems wrong, re-run extraction or report the discrepancy.

**Step 2: Identify Arrow Position**

The red vertical arrow is the population mean (50th percentile). Record its position on the 0-10 scale for both Survey and Job charts.

**Step 3: Calculate Trait Distances**

For each trait (A, B, C, D), calculate distance from arrow:

| Trait | Absolute Value | Arrow | Distance | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|-------|----------|----------------|
| A | ? | ? | ? | (will fill) |
| B | ? | ? | ? | |
| C | ? | ? | ? | |
| D | ? | ? | ? | |

**Distance interpretation:**
- 0 to ±0.5: Normative (flexible)
- ±1 to ±1.5: Tendency (moderate)
- ±2 to ±3: Pronounced (noticeable)
- ±4+: Extreme (compulsive)

**Step 4: Identify Leading Dots**

Find the dots farthest from the arrow. These drive behavior most strongly.

Rank by distance (most extreme first):
1. [Trait] at ±X centiles
2. [Trait] at ±X centiles
3. [Trait] at ±X centiles

**Step 5: Identify Pattern/Archetype**

Cross-reference with `references/patterns-archetypes.md`.

Common patterns:
- **Architect/Visionary**: High A, Low C, Low D
- **Rainmaker/Persuader**: High A, High B, Low C
- **Scholar/Specialist**: Low B, High C, High D
- **Technical Expert**: Low A, Low B, Low C, High D
- **Craftsman**: Low A, Low B, High C, High D

**Step 6: Note L and I (Absolute Values)**

These use absolute interpretation, not distance from arrow:

| Trait | Score | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Logic | 0-2: Low (emotional) | 3-7: Normative | 8-10: High (rational) |
| Ingenuity | 0-2: Low (practical) | 3-6: Occasional | 7-10: High (inventive) |

**Step 7: Summarize Strengths**

Based on leading dots, identify 2-3 key strengths:

For High A: Initiative, self-confidence, strategic thinking
For High B: Relationship building, influence, verbal communication
For High C: Patience, focus, consistency, methodical approach
For High D: Precision, reliability, quality control, accountability
For Low A: Team orientation, service mindset, execution
For Low B: Focus, analytical depth, independence
For Low C: Urgency, multitasking, adaptability
For Low D: Flexibility, big-picture thinking, risk tolerance

**Step 8: Identify Challenges**

Based on leading dots, note 2-3 potential challenges:

For High A: Difficulty with people, impatience with others, "me first" tendency
For High B: May prioritize relationships over results, needs social interaction
For High C: May resist change, slow to pivot, needs advance notice
For High D: May be inflexible, perfectionist, struggle to delegate
For Low A: May lack initiative, need clear direction, conflict avoidant
For Low B: May seem cold or disengaged, prefers solitude
For Low C: May create unnecessary urgency, interrupt others, prone to errors
For Low D: May miss details, inconsistent follow-through, forgetful

**Step 9: Check Survey vs Job**

If both graphs available, compare:
- Which dots moved significantly?
- Did arrow shift (stress/frustration signal)?
- Calculate EU utilization: (Job EU / Survey EU) × 100

**Step 10: Compile Summary**

Structure your interpretation:

```
## [Name] - [Archetype]

### Key Traits
- [Leading trait 1]: [interpretation]
- [Leading trait 2]: [interpretation]
- [Leading trait 3]: [interpretation]

### Strengths
1. [Strength 1]
2. [Strength 2]
3. [Strength 3]

### Development Areas
1. [Challenge 1]
2. [Challenge 2]

### Energy Status
- Survey EU: [X]
- Job EU: [X]
- Utilization: [X]% ([healthy/stress/frustration])

### Recommendations
- [Actionable recommendation 1]
- [Actionable recommendation 2]
```

</process>

<anti_patterns>

Avoid these interpretation mistakes:

- **Stating absolute values without context**: Never say "A is 8" without relating to arrow
- **Comparing between people using absolutes**: "Person A has higher B than Person B"
- **Value judgments**: Calling traits "good" or "bad"
- **Over-indexing on single traits**: The pattern matters more than individual dots
- **Ignoring Survey vs Job comparison**: Missing burnout signals
- **Treating as definitive**: Culture Index is one data point, not complete truth

</anti_patterns>
